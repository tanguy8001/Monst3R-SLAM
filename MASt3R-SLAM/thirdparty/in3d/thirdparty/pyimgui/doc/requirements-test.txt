# note: we still build wheels for Python2.7. pytest 5.x dropped support for
#       Python2.7 but API for discovering your own tests was relatively
#       backwards-compatible. Unfortunately 6.x isn't backwards compatible so
#       it's better set version constraint until we drop old Python versions
#       rather then add some more compat shims
